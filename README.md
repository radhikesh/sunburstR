### Help Me/Pay Me to Use, Improve, and Extend

Note:  this is a working [`htmlwidget`](http://htmlwidgets.org) first [released](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/7/2/week-26-sunburstr) in the [Building Widgets](http://buildingwidgets.org) htmlwidget-a-week project.  `sunburstR` has already seen extensive use in many projects across multiple domains.  If you have any interest in collaborating with me on this project or applying `sunburstR`, please let me know (see [Time Isn't Money](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2016/2/12/time-isnt-money)).


# sunburstR

Easily make these interactive `d3.js` sequence sunburst charts in `R` modeled on this [example](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426) from Kerry Rodden.  For more details, see this post [Week 26 | sunburstR](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/7/2/week-26-sunburstr) from the BuildingWidgets blog.

### Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/sunburstR/tree/master/inst/examples).

### Improve/Iterate

These are still far from feature-complete.  I would love your input, feedback, and comments.
